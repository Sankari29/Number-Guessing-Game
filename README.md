# Number-Guessing-Game
The Python code creates a **Number Guessing Game** using Tkinter for the user interface. It randomly generates a number between **0** and **20**, giving the player **three chances** to guess it. The interface includes an input field for guesses, a submit button, and a display area for feedback. 

The `check_guess` function compares the player's input to the generated number. It provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low and decreases the remaining attempts. If the correct number is guessed or attempts run out, a win or loss message is shown.
